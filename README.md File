# SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will stop using SyriaTel, a telecom company. Using customer usage data, we build classification models to identify high-risk customers.

## Business Problem
Customer churn leads to revenue loss and high costs for acquiring new customers. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective. Our goal is to help SyriaTel proactively reduce churn.

## Dataset
- Source: BigML SyriaTel dataset
- Records: 3,333
- Features: 21 columns, including customer demographics, call usage patterns, and service plan information.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Train-Test Split
4. Modeling:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
5. Evaluation:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Feature Importance

## Findings
- **High daytime usage and charges** strongly correlate with churn.
- **Multiple customer service calls** increase churn likelihood.
- **International plan users** are more likely to churn.

## Recommendations
1. Proactively support high-risk customers with multiple service calls.
2. Offer better pricing for high daytime users.
3. Review international plan pricing.
4. Use the model as an early warning system.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `SyriaTel_Churn.ipynb`
